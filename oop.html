<h1>object oriented programming</h1>
<br>>
<P>
    <ul>
    Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses abstraction (in the form of classes and objects) to create models based on the real world environment.  An object-oriented application uses a collection of objects, which communicate by passing messages to request services.  Objects are capable of passing messages, receiving messages, and processing data.  The aim of object-oriented programming is to try to increase the flexibility and maintainability of programs.  Because programs created using an OO language are modular, they can be easier to develop, and simpler to understand after development.

<h2>procedural programing</h2>
<br>
<p>
    <ul>
    Procedural programming can be defined as a subtype of imperative programming as a programming paradigm based upon the concept of procedure calls, in which statements are structured into procedures (also known as subroutines or functions). Procedure calls are modular and are bound by scope. A procedural program is composed of one or more modules. Each module is composed of one or more subprograms. Modules may consist of procedures, functions, subroutines or methods, depending on the programming language. Procedural programs may possibly have multiple levels or scopes, with subprograms defined inside other subprograms. Each scope can contain names which cannot be seen in outer scopes.

    Procedural programming offers many benefits over simple sequential programming since procedural code

<h2>Summary of Object-Oriented Concepts</h2>
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Everything is an object.</li>
    <li>Computation is performed by objects communicating with each other, requesting that other objects perform actions.  Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages.  A message is a request for action, bundled with whatever arguments may be necessary to complete the tasks</li>
    <li>Each object has its own memory, which consists of other objects</li>
    <li>The class is the repository for behaviour associated with an object.  That is, that all objects that are instances of the same class can perform the same actions</li>
    <li>Classes are organized into a singly rooted tree structure, called the inheritance hierarchy.  Memory and behaviour associated with instances of a class are automatically available to any class associated with a descendant in this tree structure.
    </li>
    <li> Every object is an instance of a class.  A class simply represents a grouping of similar objects, such as Integers or lists</li>
